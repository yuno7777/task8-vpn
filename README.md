# Elevate Labs Task 8 – VPN Setup 

## Task Overview
The task was to set up a free VPN, verify its functionality, and understand how it helps protect online privacy.

## What I Did
- Installed and configured UrbanVPN (free tier).
- Connected to a server and verified IP change using whatismyipaddress.com.
- Compared browsing before and after VPN connection.
- Identified and removed unnecessary/suspicious browser extensions.
- Researched VPN encryption, tunneling protocols, and privacy features.

## Key Learning
- VPNs encrypt traffic, mask IP addresses, and protect data on public networks.
- VPNs improve privacy but may reduce speed and don’t guarantee full anonymity.
