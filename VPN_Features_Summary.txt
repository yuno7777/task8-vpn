VPN Encryption and Privacy Features

- Encryption: VPNs use strong algorithms to secure traffic in real time, protecting passwords, banking info, and messages.
- IP Masking: Hides your real IP, replacing it with the VPN server’s IP.
- No-Logs Policy: Many providers claim they don’t log browsing activity (trust depends on provider).
- DNS Leak Protection: Stops DNS queries from leaking outside the VPN tunnel.
- Kill Switch: Blocks all traffic if the VPN disconnects, preventing exposure.
